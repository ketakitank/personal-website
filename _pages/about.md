Hi! I'm Ketaki Tank, a second-year Master's student in Computer Science and Engineering at UC San Diego, specializing in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning.

## Current Work

I'm currently looking for research opportunities where I potentially work on projects exploring **Large Language Models (LLMs) and Machine Unlearning**, while serving as a Teaching Assistant for a course titled "Systems for LLMs and AI Agents"

## Recent Experience

**Fall 2025** -  I am serving as a Teaching Assistant for CSE 291A: Systems for LLMs and AI Agents, where I am helping curate the course content, lead projects and help 200+ graduate students.

**Summer 2025** - I interned at [Aurora Inc.](https://aurora.tech/) in Mountain View, California as a Software Development Engineer Intern for 12 weeks, where I will contribute to building a durable backend pipeline, enabling efficient tracking and reporting of quality regressions through searchable data infrastructure.

**Spring 2025** - I served as a Teaching Assistant for CSE 253: Machine Learning for Music, where I **helped 1000+ students** explore how machine learning techniques can generate and understand symbolic music.
