Hi! I’m Ketaki Tank, a first-year Master’s student in Computer Science and Engineering at UC San Diego, specializing in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning.

I’m currently involved in research at Professor Julian McAuley’s Lab, where I work on projects exploring **Large Language Models (LLMs) and Machine Unlearning**—an exciting intersection of data privacy and deep learning. This Spring (2025), I’m also serving as a Teaching Assistant for CSE 253: Machine Learning for Music, **helping 1000+ students** explore how machine learning techniques can generate and understand symbolic music.
