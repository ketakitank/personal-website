Hi! I'm Ketaki Tank, a first-year Master's student in Computer Science and Engineering at UC San Diego, specializing in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning.

## Current Work

I'm currently involved in research at Professor Julian McAuley's Lab, where I work on projects exploring **Large Language Models (LLMs) and Machine Unlearning**â€”an exciting intersection of data privacy and deep learning.

## Recent Experience

**Spring 2025** - I served as a Teaching Assistant for CSE 253: Machine Learning for Music, where I **helped 1000+ students** explore how machine learning techniques can generate and understand symbolic music.

**Summer 2025** - I will be interning at [Aurora Inc.](https://aurora.tech/) in Mountain View, California as a Software Development Engineer Intern for 12 weeks, where I will contribute to building a durable backend pipeline, enabling efficient tracking and reporting of quality regressions through searchable data infrastructure.
